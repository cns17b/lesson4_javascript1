### Project Description:
In this assignment, we learned how to declare variables in JavaScript by using a template to complete an expenses calculator.  We also learned how to use the getElementById method in JavaScript, and how to use this method to change a page when an event (in this case, the press of a button on the HTML page) occurs.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We learned the difference between static and dynamic typefaces (JavaScript uses a dynamic typeface).  In a static typeface, like Java, when you declare a variable, you must assign the variable a single type, and the value(s) of that variable must be of that type.  In a dynamic typeface, like JavaScript, when declaring a variable, you do not need to specify the type, and the type may change through the program, as any value may be stored in the variable.
2. We learned how to initialize a variable in JavaScript using the keyword Var, followed by the name of the variable.  We learned that you do not need to have a value for the variable when you declare it, and that you may declare multiple variables at the same time (seperating them with a comma, ending the last one with a semicolon).  If you do not put var in front of the variable, it becomes a global variable, which has a value that is known throughout the entirety of the code.
3. We learned how we may create a dynamic webpage using JavaScript (for example, using the getElementById funcion in JavaScript in this assignment to preform calculations on our HTML page and display the results).  We also learned what a node is on a page, and how JavaScript can interact with those nodes to manipulate their value(s), add new nodes, delete notes, etc.
